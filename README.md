# FIGHTING GAME BASE

This project is the base code for the fighting game I am developing, the goal is to create a simple base that can be extended into multiple different fighting game's in future

## Goals
- Creating an easy to use base for characters
- pre-implemented local multiplayer for 2 people
- large but scalable system to work with in future

## Installation
Since this is a simple and small project, all you have to do to install is download all the project files (or create your own branch if you're me :D), and then start coding away

## Usage
Once downloaded onto your pc, simply add the project to your unity project list, and it will all be ready for you to work on

## License
Free if you don't sell it (read license), but why would you use my mid code ?
