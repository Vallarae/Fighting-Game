# FIGHTING GAME BASE

This project is the base code for the fighting game I am developing, the goal is to create a simple base that can be extended into multiple different fighting game's in future

## Goals
- Creating an easy to use base for characters
- pre-implemented local multiplayer for 2 people
- large but scalable system to work with in future

## Installation
Since this is a simple and small project, all you have to do to install is download all the project files (or create your own branch if you're me :D), and then start coding away

## Usage
Once downloaded onto your pc, simply add the project to your unity project list, and it will all be ready for you to work on

## Contributing
If you somehow find this and are in a goofy enough mood to help, feel free to message me on Discord (user: Vallarae) and send a link to the branch you're working on so I can merge it.

That said, this *is* a private repo-so if you're reading this and aren't supposed to be here, please tell me how you got in 🙏
(This section mostly exists so the README looks less empty ;-;)

## License
Doesn't exist rn, just credit me if you for some reason end up using this, because it took me a lot of time to make ;-;
