# FIGHTING GAME BASE

This project is the base code for the fighting game I am developing, the goal is to create a simple base that can be extended into multiple different fighting game's in future

## Goals
- Creating an easy to use base for characters
- pre-implemented local multiplayer for 2 people
- large but scalable system to work with in future

## Installation
Since this is a simple and small project, all you have to do to install is download all the project files (or create your own branch if you're me :D), and then start coding away

## Usage
Once downloaded onto your pc, simply add the project to your unity project list, and it will all be ready for you to work on

## Contributing
If you happen to find this and for some reason are in a goofy enough mood to help, simply give me a message on discord (Vallarae) and send a link to the branch you are working on so that I can add it to the main project. However, this is a private repo, so if you somehow have found it please tell me how :pray: (I mainly put this bit in to make the readme fill less empty ;-;)

## License
Doesn't exist rn, just credit me if you for some reason end up using this, because it took me a lot of time to make ;-;
